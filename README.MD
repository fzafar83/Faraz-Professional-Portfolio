Challenge-2: Faraz Professional Portfolio


**Description** : As per the requirement of the challenge I had to create a professional portfolio. My motivsation while doing this challenge was to implement various rules, and elements of HTML and CSS. I had to create a navigation bar, header, body with couple sections, and the footer with information in them. I also used dev tools to check my work and tweeked my code to look for the effect of applying CSS elements. 

**The User Story**
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

**Acceptance Criteria**
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
